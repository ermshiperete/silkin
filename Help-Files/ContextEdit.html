        <h3>What Exactly Is the Context?</h3>
        <p>
            In SILKin our main focus is to learn the kinship terminology for a particular culture or language. 
            A set of definitions for all the kin terms is called a 'Domain Theory' (a computer science term). In
            some cultures there are two sets of kin terms: terms of reference and terms of address. But there is
            only one population of people and families, only one set of mores for marriage and courtesy, etc. 
            We say that the entire culture is the Context of our effort while we focus on learning one or two
            sets of kin terms (reference and address).
        </p>
        <p>
        	The Context for any SILKin project contains one or two domain theories, all the people and families,
        	etc. Whenever you Save (or Save As) your work in a SILK file, you are saving the entire Context.
       </p>

        <h3>The Context Editor</h3>
        <p>
            Most of your time will be spent building family tree charts and recording the kin terms that people
            use with one another. Periodically, you will ask SILKin for suggestions and will act on those suggestions:
            gathering disambiguating data, confirming or denying synonyms and umbrella terms, and accepting or 
            rejecting proposed definitions for kin terms in this context (the 'domain theory' we are trying to learn). 
            None of this activity requires the Context Editor.             
        </p>
        <p>
        	But a few things can only be done in the Context Editor:
        	<ul>
        	<li>View the records of persons or families that were deleted in the chart.</li>
        	<li>Un-delete persons or families.</li>
        	<li>View, Edit or Create User Defined Properties.</li>
        	<li>Edit or annotate one of the Domain Theories for this context.</li>
        	<li>Make notes and commentary about this culture that will be retained in the SILK file.</li>
        	<li>In a future version of SILKin, you can view and edit the matrix of kin terms
        		for this context as a two-dimensional table.</li>
        	</ul>
       </p>
 		<p>You can also do two things here that duplicate other screens: indicate whether polygamy is permitted
 		in this culture, and whether there are distinct terms of address.

        <h3>Deleted Records</h3>
        <p> When working on the Chart, you can <a href="Chart#del-ppl">delete a person or a family</a> with your mouse. 
            If the person/family deleted was the last one created (has the highest serial number), SILKin will
            remove all trace of it. But if you delete the person with serial number 17 when there are higher serial numbers
            in existence, SILKin will mark that person as 'deleted' and they will disappear from your chart. But
            their record will still exist in the database. You can view it in the Context Editor in the 'View/Edit
            Person' drop-down list.
        </p>
        <p> If you click on a person in the 'View/Edit Person' list, an editor window will open that allows you to
        edit their properties. <span style="font-style: italic">In general, you should NOT use this editor to change a person's
        properties. Use the chart window.</span> But this is the only way to view a deleted person. It is also the only way to 
        un-delete a person. Clicking on the Un-Delete button will make the person visible and usable again. Because SILKin
        cannot put the un-deleted person in their former position in the chart (it may have changed), the un-deleted
        person will appear in the upper left corner of the chart. You can drag them to wherever you want them.
        </p>
        <p>

            In the theory editor window you may edit the Primary Author and the citation of any publication containing further information about
            your work. Or these fields may remain blank if you like. Below these are a profusion of buttons and menus that allow you to view and 
            edit definitions of kin terms, or <a href="#edit-comments">edit related comments</a>.
            <li>A drop-down menu of '<span style="font-weight: bold">Pre-Defined Terms</span>' contains all the relationship terms (or <span style="font-style: italic">predicates</span>)
                    that SILKin understands automatically. This is a fairly long list, with the most frequently used terms at the top of the list. When this menu is open, 
                    you can type the first few letters of a term and the list will scroll to that term. </li>
