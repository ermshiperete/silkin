        <h3>General Layout of the Theory Editor Window</h3>
        <p>
            This page explains how to edit definitions in SILKin. When a SILK file has been opened in SILKin, choosing 'Edit  >  Edit Context'
            will open a Context Editor window. Near the bottom of the context editor is a box containing the Kinship System Domain Theories
            (i.e. definitions). If your target language does not have separate Terms of Address, there will only be a theory for Terms of
            Reference. If you click on an 'Edit Theory' button, it will open a theory editor for that set of definitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the theory editor window you may edit the Primary Author and the citation of any publication containing further information about
            your work. Or these fields may remain blank if you like. Below these are a profusion of buttons and menus that allow you to view and 
            edit definitions of kin terms, or <a href="#edit-comments">edit related comments</a>.
            <ul>
                <li>A drop-down menu of 'Kin Terms &amp; Edits In Progress' contains all the kin terms that have been seen so far.
                    They are grouped into 3 categories:
                    <ol>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Edits In Progress</span> From the time you start editing a definition until you finally
                            either delete the edit or accept the definition, that kin term will be in this section. If you choose an edit in progress from
                            this section, you will be able to resume your editing where you left off in a prior session.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Defined Local Terms</span> All kin terms in the local language for which you have accepted a 
                            definition will appear in this section. If you choose a defined term from this section, it will be displayed in the editing
                            window so you can view it, but the 'Display is editable' check box will be un-checked (to prevent unintentional changes). 
                            If you wish to revise an accepted definition, you can click the 'editable' box and then edit it. (That will move this kin term
                            into the edits-in-progress section until you complete your editing.) </li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Undefined Local Terms</span> All other kin terms that appear in the data. If you choose a 
                            kin term from this section, you can craft a definition from scratch. If you create, validate, and accept the definition, then
                            this kin term will be moved into the 'Defined' section. </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>A drop-down menu of '<span style="font-weight: bold">Auxiliary Terms</span>.' This menu is empty at first, but you define any 
                    auxiliary terms here. Auxiliaries are explained <a href="#auxiliaries">below.</a></li>
                <li>Below these two drop-down menus is a text field. This is where definition are displayed and/or edited. If a definition is display-only, 
                    the 'Display is editable' check box will be un-checked (to prevent unintentional changes). If you check that box, then you may edit
                    the text in this area. </li>
                <li>A drop-down menu of '<span style="font-weight: bold">Pre-Defined Terms</span>' contains all the relationship terms (or <span style="font-style: italic">predicates</span>)
                    that SILKin understands automatically. This is a fairly long list, with the most frequently used terms at the top of the list. When this menu is open, 
                    you can type the first few letters of a term and the list will scroll to that term. </li>
                <li>The '<span style="font-weight: bold">Insert</span>' button next to the 'Pre-Defined Terms' will insert the selected term from that menu into the editing area.</li>
                <li>The '<span style="font-weight: bold">Period</span>' button will place a period at the end of a clause, and perform some other functions described 
                    <a href="#variable-generation">below.</a> </li>
                <li>The '<span style="font-weight: bold">Insert</span>' button next to the 'Defined Local Terms' will insert the selected local term into the editing area.</li>
                <li>A drop-down menu of '<span style="font-weight: bold">Defined Local Terms</span>' contains all the kin terms in the local language that have accepted definitions. Once a definition
                    is accepted for a local term, it can be used in other definitions as a <span style="font-style: italic">predicate</span>. 
                </li>                    
            </ul>
            The remaining four buttons and two check boxes are explained <a href="#bottom-buttons">below.</a> Before discussing them, we must describe carefully the
            things we will be editing: Horn Clauses.
        </p>
        <a name="tutorial"></a> 
        <h3> What Is A Horn Clause? </h3>
        <p>There are several ways you could express the definition of a kin term. Let's use the English term 'aunt' as an example. 
            <ol type="A">
                <li>You could draw a family tree diagram of Ego and all the people Ego calls 'aunt'. That would look like the
                    charts we draw in SILKin. </li>
                <li>You could use a gloss -- kin terms to describe the chain of linking kinsmen between Ego and Alter -- for each type of aunt.
                    That would look like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>mother's sister</li>
                        <li>mother's brother's wife</li>
                        <li>father's sister</li>
                        <li>father's brother's wife</li>
                    </ul>                    
                </li>
                <li>You could write a sequence of <span style="font-style: italic">relations</span> that express the kinship between two
                    people, using <span style="font-style: italic">variables</span> to represent each person. That would look like this:
                    <ol>
                        <li>mother(B, Ego), sister(Alter, B).</li>
                        <li>mother(B, Ego), brother(C, B), wife(Alter, C).</li>
                        <li>father(B, Ego), sister(Alter, B).</li>
                        <li>father(B, Ego), brother(C, B), wife(Alter, C).</li>
                    </ol>           
                </li>
            </ol>
            A gloss is certainly the most compact expression of a definition. But the series of relations is only slightly less compact. When these 
            series are written according a simple set of rules, they are called <span style="font-style: italic">Horn Clauses</span>. A Horn Clause has
            several nice properties:
            <ul>
                <li>It specifies precisely who is related to whom in which way. Even in a very complex definition, there is never any ambiguity.</li>
                <li>It allows for <span style="font-style: italic">constraints</span> to be specified precisely. For instance, if seniority were
                    part of the definition, we could write 'elder(Alter, Ego)' to specify that the kin term only applies if Alter is older than
                    Ego. </li>
                <li>It can express any definition, no matter how complex, without any footnotes or other explanations.</li>
                <li>A computer can easily understand and manipulate Horn Clauses. SILKin stores definitions
                    in the form of Horn Clauses. Whenever desired, SILKin can produce a chart or a gloss from a Horn Clause (although they may
                    not be able to display all the information in a Horn Clause, like seniority).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <a name="rules"></a>  
        <h3> Rules For Writing Horn Clauses </h3>
        <p>Writing Horn Clauses is fairly simple. Each way a person can qualify for the kin term is expressed in a separate clause.
            In our example above, there are four different ways one can qualify as an 'aunt' in English, so there are four clauses. Each clause is independent
            of the others. The variable &quot;B&quot; may represent one particular person in one clause, and someone else in another clause.            
        </p>
        <p>
            The components of a Horn Clause, the individual relations, are called <span style="font-style: italic">literals</span> by mathematicians
            and computer geeks. A literal has a <span style="font-style: italic">predicate</span> that names the relation, followed by the 
            <span style="font-style: italic">arguments</span> in parentheses. In our second example above -- the literal 'mother(B, Ego), brother(C, B), wife(Alter, C).'
            -- the predicates are 'mother', 'brother', and 'wife'. The predicate 'mother' has two arguments: 'B' and 'Ego'. A literal consists of one predicate
            and its arguments enclosed in parentheses. Multiple arguments are separated by commas. Multiple literals are also separated by commas. 
            Notice that predicates and arguments are not alike:
            <ul>
                <li>A predicate always starts with a lower-case letter. </li>
                <li>Predicates must be understood by the computer, so they must come from the list of 'Pre-Defined Terms' or 'Defined Local Terms'.</li>
                <li>An argument always begins with a capital letter. Arguments are also called <span style="font-style: italic">variables</span>. </li>
                <li>Two arguments (variables) are required in every clause: Ego and Alter. Other than that, arguments may be anything we like. By 
                    tradition, the series of capital letters are used for arguments: B, C, D, F, G, H, etc. In SILKin we don't use 'A' or 'E' to
                    avoid any confusion with Alter and Ego. </li>
                <li>Most of the Pre-Defined Terms (predicates like 'mother') require two arguments. For example: the literal 'mother(B, Ego)' specifies that B is the mother of Ego.
                    If you use the 'mother' predicate but only write one argument (e.g. 'mother(B)') this is a syntax error. </li>
                <li>A few predicates take only one argument: 'dead(C)' or 'female(F)'. </li>
                <li>The names of predicates must consist of letters, numbers, underscores ('_') and square brackets ('[' and ']'). The Pre-Defined Terms all
                    follow this rule (e.g. 'half_brother'). When devising names for local kin terms, you must follow this rule also.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>When there are multiple literals in a clause, they are separated by commas. There is a period after the final literal.             
        </p>
        <p>When there are multiple clauses in a definition (e.g. 'aunt' above has four clauses), the first clause is preceded by a literal that represents what is being defined:
            for example 'aunt(Alter, Ego)' and a special symbol ':-' that means &quot;is defined as.&quot;  All clauses after the first one are preceded by the
            special symbol '|' that means &quot;OR&quot;. To illustrate these rules, here is how the formal definition of English 'aunt' is written in Horn Clauses:            
        </p>
        <pre>
   aunt(Alter, Ego) :- mother(B, Ego), sister(Alter, B).
                    |  mother(B, Ego), brother(C, B), wife(Alter, C).
                    |  father(B, Ego), sister(Alter, B).
                    |  father(B, Ego), brother(C, B), wife(Alter, C).
        </pre>
        <p>
            Once we get used to Horn Clauses, we can read a clause like a sentence, or read multiple clauses like a paragraph. Here is how we would
            read the 'paragraph' above that defines the concept of English 'aunt.' 
            <pre>
Alter is the aunt of Ego if:
    B is mother of Ego, and Alter is sister of B.
OR  B is mother of Ego, C is brother of B, and Alter is wife of C.
OR  B is father of Ego, and Alter is sister of B.
OR  B is father of Ego, C is brother of B, and Alter is wife of C. </pre>
        </p>
        <p>There is one more rule for writing Horn Clauses: there must be a chain of relations leading from Ego to Alter. For example, in the second clause
            of our 'aunt' definition we say that B is the mother of Ego, and C is the brother of B, and Alter is the wife of C. 'B' and 'C' are the two 
            linking kinsmen between Ego and Alter. If the chain of linking kinsmen is broken (e.g. by misspelling a variable) then the definition is invalid
            and SILKin will reject it.             
        </p>
        <p>Here are some examples of <span style="font-weight: bold">incorrect clauses</span>:
            <ul>
                <li><code>mother(B, Ego), sister(Alter, B),</code> <br/>The clause does not end with a period.</li>
                <li><code>father(B, Ego), Sister(Alter, B).</code> <br/>The predicate 'sister' is misspelled. All predicates must begin with a lower-case letter.</li>
                <li><code>mother(B, Ego), brother(c, B), wife(Alter, C).</code> <br/>The variable 'c' is lower-case. All variables must begin with a capital  
                    letter. Also, since variable names are case-sensitive, SILKin will say there is no chain of relations between Ego and Alter because
                    'c' and 'C' are not the same. </li>
                <li><code>mother(B, Ego), sister(Alter).</code> <br/>The predicate 'sister' requires two arguments.</li>
                <li><code>father(B Ego)  sister(Alter,B).</code> <br/>The arguments in the first literal are not separated by commas. Also, the two literals
                    are not separated by commas. </li>
            </ul></p>
        
        <a name="pre-defined-terms"></a>
        <h3> Pre-Defined Terms Available For Use in Definitions</h3>
        <p>
            You need only a few basic relations to build a genealogical chart. You can tie all the people and families together using just parent-child and 
            spouse relations. If we also use the relations to specify the gender of Alter, we need just 6 basic relations, or predicates:
            <ul>
                <li>father, mother, son, daughter, husband, wife</li>
            </ul>
            For convenience, SILKin pre-defines other commonly-used, gender-specific kin terms:
            <ul>
                <li>brother, sister, half_brother, half_sister, step_brother, step_sister</li>
                <li>step_mother, step_father, step_son, step_daughter</li>
            </ul>
            SILKin also provides constraint predicates that allow you to express restrictions on the applicability of a clause. If a kin term in the
            local language means &quot;younger brother&quot; then we need predicates like 'elder' or 'younger' to express the restriction. So SILKin
            provides several constraint predicates:
             <ul>
                <li>male, female, gender, dead, divorced, elder, younger</li>
                <li>equal, not, contains, greaterThan, lessThan, greaterOrEql, lessOrEql</li>
            </ul>
            Sometimes it is easier to use a gender-neutral predicate in a definition, so SILKin pre-defines these:
            <ul>
                <li>parent, child, spouse, sibling</li>
                <li>parents, children, spice, siblings, </li>
            </ul>
            It may seem curious that SILKin provides both 'child' and 'children' for use in definitions, but there is a reason. If we have a definition
            where the gender of one person is constrained to be the same as another's, we could use two clauses to record this: one for the male case and
            another for the female case. It is always OK to use that simple approach. But some may prefer the compactness of using a single clause. If,
            for example, the kin term means &quot;same-sex sibling&quot; we might write <code>
                sibling(Alter, Ego), gender(B, Ego), gender(B, Alter).
            </code>
            That clause would make the definition clear to a human reader, but if we asked SILKin to draw a chart of this kin term, it would draw a single
            diagram where Ego is male (or female) and Ego's sibling has the same gender. But to be really precise, SILKin should draw 
            <span style="font-style: italic">two</span> examples: one for male and another for female, to make it clear the definition works for both genders.
            When SILKin sees a plural gender-neutral predicate (e.g. siblings or spice), it knows that when creating examples or drawing charts it must
            generate <span style="font-style: italic">both</span> cases. So the best way to write &quot;same-sex sibling&quot; would be:<code>
                siblings(Alter, Ego), gender(B, Ego), gender(B, Alter).
            </code>
            That is the same as writing two clauses, one with a male Ego and one with a female Ego. See the next two sections for other examples of how to use
            gender-neutral predicates and a good rule-of-thumb.
        </p>
        <a name="auxiliaries"></a>
        <h3> Auxiliary Terms</h3>
        <p>
            Auxiliary terms are another potential convenience. You do not need to define or use any auxiliaries, but you may if you wish. Auxiliaries provide
            a way to define a <span style="font-style: italic">concept</span> in the local language that does not correspond to a single kin term. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For example: perhaps the local language includes the concept of 'cross cousin' but has separate terms for male cross cousin and female cross cousin.
            It would be convenient to define the cross cousin concept as it is used in the local language (there are many different interpretations around the
            world), then plug that concept into definitions wherever needed. Because there is no kin term for 'cross cousin' we need an auxiliary term.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rules for auxiliaries are simple. The name you choose for this predicate must start with a lower-case letter and must contain &quot;[aux]&quot;
            inside the name. In this case, we might choose 'cross_cousin[aux]' as the name of our auxiliary term. We click on the 'Auxiliary Terms' drop-down
            menu and choose 'Define  New Auxiliary Term'. We are prompted for a valid name, then we can begin to write the definition in the editing area.
        </p>
        <p>
            As soon as we provide the name, SILKin puts into the editing area <br/>
            <code>cross_cousin[aux](Alter, Ego) :- </code> <br/>
            to start our definition. In the local
            language, the only requirement is that a cross cousin must be the child of your parent's opposite-sex sibling.  The gender of neither Ego nor Alter matters.
            So we write the following definition in the editing area:</p>
            <code>parents(B, Ego), sibling(C, B), children(Alter, C), gender(D, B), gender(E, C), not(equal(D, E)).</code> 
        <p>By assigning separate variables to the genders of B and C, and then specifying that those gender variables (D and E) cannot be equal, we have expressed
            the local meaning of &quot;cross&quot;. As soon as we validate and accept the definition of this auxiliary term (as described 
            <a href="#bottom-buttons">below</a>), 'cross_cousin[aux]' will appear in the menu of 'Defined Local Terms' and we can use it in definitions of other terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that we used the plural 'parents' in this definition (it applies to both male and female parents) and also the plural 'children' (the gender of
            the cousin doesn't matter). But we did not use the plural of 'sibling'. Why not? Because (when generating examples) SILKin will generate samples for both
            a male parent and a female parent. But once the gender of the parent has been chosen, the gender of the sibling <span style="font-style: italic">must</span>
            be the opposite. So SILKin cannot generate both a male and a female sibling for the male parent. We use 'sibling' (singular) so that SILKin will not try to generate
            both genders for C. The rule of thumb is: <span style="font-style: italic">Use a singular gender-neutral predicate if some constraints in the clause will
            restrict the gender. Use a plural gender-neutral predicate if there are no constraints on the gender, and you want to be sure SILKin generates both cases

        <h3> Validating and Accepting Definitions</h3>
        <p>
            After you have written or edited a definition in Horn Clause form, SILKin must validate the definition before it can be accepted. The 
            'Syntax Check' button asks SILKin to verify that you have followed all the rules for writing Horn Clauses, spelled predicates correctly, etc.
            The sample session below illustrates the kinds of syntax errors SILKin can detect. We have tried to anticipate the more common errors, but if
            you try you can probably make a creative mistake that will completely perplex the syntax checker. If you fail the syntax check but cannot
            see anything wrong with your definition, perhaps a colleague can focus fresh eyes on the clause and suggest a solution. If all else fails,
            email your SILK file (your edits-in-progress are in it) to the support address shown on the site where you downloaded SILKin. The project team
            will inspect your definition and tell you why it failed the test.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Once you pass the syntax check, you may need to perform a dyad check. (If you are editing or creating an auxiliary term definition, you may
            skip the dyad check &mdash; an auxiliary term will not have any dyads associated with it.) In a dyad check, SILKin examines every dyad in your
            data. If there are any dyads for this kin term that do not fit your definition, you will be informed. Also, if there are any dyads for some
            other kin term that fit this definition, you will be informed. You will have the option of examining a list of the misfit dyads.
        </p>
        <p>
            Until you resolve the misfit dyads, the 'Accept Def' button will not light up. Usually you can resolve the misfits in one of the following ways:
            <ul>
                <li>If your definition does not cover some legitimate dyads for this kin term, you can add one or more clauses that cover these additional
                ways that someone can qualify for this kin term.</li>
                <li>If a misfit dyad is incorrect, you can go back to the chart and correct the kin term data. For example, if you discover an incorrect
                dyad for Ego = #4 and Alter = #12, go the chart, change Ego to #4 and then click on #12 as Alter. Correct (or delete) the kin term shown in the 
                'Ego calls Alter' field. </li>
                <li>If your definition covers some cases that it should not, but there are no apparent errors in your dyads, you must carefully analyze
                    <span style="font-style: italic">why</span> these cases should not be included in your definition. Is there perhaps a constraint 
                    that you failed to include in a clause? Is there a non-genealogical factor involved?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a large collection of dyads, and your definition fits all but a small number of cases, SILKin may ignore this 'noise in the
            data' and allow you to pass the dyad check. The percentage of 'noise' allowed in your data is determined by the parameter 'Ignorable %' in
            <a href="Prefs.html#ignore"> the 'Edit Prefs' screen</a>. 
        </p><p>
            When you have passed the syntax check and the dyad check, you may click 'Accept Def' to add the definition to the domain theory for this
            language. Once it is accepted, this kin term will be automatically applied to any new Ego/Alter pair who fit the definition. You will be
            given the option to retroactively apply it to all pairs who fit.
        </p>

        <h3> A Sample Session in the Theory Editor</h3>
        <p>
            Jean has been gathering genealogical data about the XYZ people for several weeks. He chose &quot;Get New Suggestions&quot; recently, and SILKin
            suggested two definitions that seemed reasonable, so he accepted them. Jean thinks he has figured out the definition of a third term on his own.
            After loading his SILK file he chooses 'Edit Context.' In the context editor he clicks on 'Edit Theory' and the theory editor opens up.
            He chooses one of the accepted definitions from the 'Kin Terms &amp; Edits In Progress' menu and it is displayed in the editing area. He wants to
            edit his definition, so he clicks the 'Display is editable' check box at the bottom of the editor window; now he can place his cursor in the text of
            the definition and make changes. He sees the following in the editing area:
         </p>
        <pre>
   gerbis(Alter, Ego) :- mother(B, Ego), sister(Alter, B).
                      |  mother(B, Ego), brother(C, B), wife(Alter, C).
                      |  father(B, Ego), sister(Alter, B).
                      |  father(B, Ego), brother(C, B), wife(Alter, C).
        </pre>
        <p>
            The definition of 'gerbis' is exactly the same as the English 'aunt' above (how convenient for this example!). 
            Jean wants to replace the four clauses with just two that begin with 'parents.' So he changes 'mother' to 'parents' in the first two clauses and deletes
            the last two clauses. Now he has this:
        </p>
        <pre>
   gerbis(Alter, Ego) :- parents(B, Ego), sister(Alter, B).
                      |  parents(B, Ego), brother(C, B), wife(Alter, C).
        </pre>
        <p>
            Jean clicks the 'Syntax Check' button; he gets the message that his syntax is good, and the 'Dyad Check' button is enabled. Pressing the 'Dyad Check'
            button produces another message that everything is OK and the 'Accept Def' button is enabled. He clicks that button and the new statement of the definition
            becomes official. SILKin will use this two-clause version from now on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now Jean clicks on the 'Kin Terms &amp; Edits In Progress' menu and scrolls down the list of undefined local terms to 'brac.' He has figured out that this
            kin term means &quot;daughter's child&quot;. As soon as he clicks on 'brac' the beginning of the definition is generated in the editing area and the
            'Display is editable' box is checked. He enters his definition, making the editing area look like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
brac(Alter, Ego) :- daughter(B, Ego) child(Alter, B)
        </pre>
        <p>
            He does not notice his typing errors, so he presses the 'Syntax Check' button. SILKin responds with the message<br/>
            <code>KSBadHornClauseException: Each Horn Clause must end with a period. Found no period in &quot; daughter(B, Ego) child(Alter, B) &quot;
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            He adds the missing period. If he doesn't see his other error, pressing the 'Syntax Check' button again will produce <br/>
<pre>There is likely a punctuation error or missing comma somewhere near the '***' in:
daughter(B, Ego) *** child(Alter, B).
(Multiple arguments should be separated by commas.
 Also, multiple literals are separated by commas.)
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>Jean adds the missing comma between literals (after &quot;Ego)&quot;) and presses 'Syntax Check' once more. This time he sees
            <code>Syntax is correct for this definition</code> and the 'Dyad Check' button lights up. This means he can now check his definition
            against the data (dyads) he has gathered for the term 'brac'.            
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE:</span> Passing the Syntax Check successfully causes the 'Dyad Check' button to light up. And if the 
            Dyad Check is passed the 'Accept Def' button lights up. But if Jean makes any further edits (changing just a single character), all the
            buttons will dim except 'Syntax Check.' If he wants to be sure he does not inadvertently change the definition, he may un-check the 
            'Display is editable' check box; this prevents accidental changes.
        </p>
        
        <a name="variable-generation"></a>
        <h3> Automatic Variable Generation</h3>
        <p>
            SILKin is very strict about the syntax of definitions. The smallest error in typing a predicate or variable &mdash; or a small punctuation
            mistake &mdash; will cause your definition to fail the Syntax Check. As a convenience, SILKin offers automatic variable generation.
            Whenever you are typing <span style="font-style: italic">at the end</span> of your definition (i.e. adding new literals) 
            if 'Automatic Variable Generation' is checked 
            you can simply scroll to and select the predicate you want, click 'Insert,' and SILKin will insert the predicate and 
            <span style="font-style: italic">try</span> to generate a set of variables in parentheses. If it can't figure out what they should be,
            it may generate a capital letter you don't want. Our guess is that it's easier to edit an incorrect variable name than it is to type the
            whole literal. If you find this feature annoying, turn it off by un-checking the box.
        </p>
        <p>
            When using Automatic Variable Generation, the last literal inserted will have a generated variable and the literal will be followed by 
            a comma. If you click on 'Period' the last variable generated will be changed to 'Alter' and the final comma will be replaced with a period.
            This will complete your clause in the usual way. If you need to insert constraints, you must do this manually.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE:</span> If you are editing in the middle of an existing clause, SILKin will not even attempt to
            guess the variables you might want. You can still use 'Insert' to insert a predicate, but it will be followed by empty parentheses 
            where you may type the proper variables. The 'Period' button will be ineffective.
        </p>
        <a name="edit-comments"></a>
        <h3> Editing Comments</h3>
        <p> 
            There is a 'Comments' field associated with each accepted definition, plus one for the entire context. When the 'Edit Def'
            button is selected (below the editing area), you can edit definitions. When the 'Edit Comments' button is selected, you can edit
            the comments associated with an <span style="font-style: italic">accepted</span> definition. These comments are stored on the
            SILK file; they might be useful for documenting special circumstances or meanings of a kin term. Or they might explain why the
            User has written the Horn Clause in a particular way.
        </p>
        <p>
            To edit the comments associated with the defined kin term 'gerbis' you would select that term in the 'Kin Terms &amp; Edits
            In Progress' menu, then click on 'Edit Comments.' Note that the syntax and dyad checks (as well as acceptance) are not available
            for comments. Whatever you type in the editing area will be stored in the SILK file.
        </p>
        <p>
            To edit your commentary on the entire context, select the titles of the 'Kin Terms &amp; Edits In Progress' and 'Auxiliary Terms' 
            menus. (The editing area will say &quot;[No definition selected for editing.]&quot;) Then click the 'Edit Comments' button and the
            context comments will be displayed for editing. There is no limit on the length of your comments (except the memory available on your
            computer), but SILKin is not a word processor. Please note that if you have separate theories for Terms of Reference and Terms of
            Address, your comments about both of them will appear together in the context's comments. You should label them clearly.
