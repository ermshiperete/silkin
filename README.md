<b>SILKin</b> is a generic Java app with 2 major functions:
<ol>
<li>Support a field worker who is gathering genealogical data and kin terms in order to analyze the kinship terminology and concepts in a new language. Allow User to draw family tree diagrams, labeling each node (person or family) with details e.g. name, birth & death dates, and kin terms relative to a particular Ego. Record the kinship data in dyads.<br>
</li> <li>
When invoked by User, apply a Machine Learning algorithm to the collected data (dyads) to induce definitions for each kin term and identify similarities to previously-analyzed kinship systems in the SILKin library. In addition to proposing definitions, also identify potential synonyms, umbrella terms, or anomalies in the data.<br>
</li> </ol>
<b>Latest Release of SILKin is 2.1.1</b>
