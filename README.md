<b>SILKin</b> is a generic Java app with 2 major functions:
<ol>
<li>Support a field worker who is gathering genealogical data and kin terms in order to analyze the kinship terminology and concepts in a new language. Allow User to draw family tree diagrams, labeling each node (person or family) with details e.g. name, birth & death dates, and kin terms relative to a particular Ego. Record the kinship data in dyads.<br>
</li> <li>
When invoked by User, apply a Machine Learning algorithm to the collected data (dyads) to induce definitions for each kin term and identify similarities to previously-analyzed kinship systems in the SILKin library. In addition to proposing definitions, also identify potential synonyms, umbrella terms, or anomalies in the data.<br>
</li> </ol>
<b>Release of SILKin 2.1</b>
This release includes a number of fixes including support for right-to-left Scripts. There is a Windows installer available too. To get the released versions (rather than the source which is available on this site) got to http://www.sil.org/resources/software_fonts/silkin

<b>INITIAL RELEASE OF SILKin 1.0</b>
Our initial release was posted December 12, 2011. The file and brief instructions are in the "Downloads" area of this site.

<b>UPDATED RELEASE 1.1</b>
Version 1.1 allows editing of Horn Clauses (an advanced feature -- new users need not worry about it). It also permits printing of genealogical charts. And, naturally, many many bug fixes.

<b>UPDATED RELEASE 1.2</b>
Version 1.2 allows multiple (family tree) genealogical charts for a single population. So a User can, for example, have each family on its own chart. Links (pointers to people on other charts) allow documenting marriages etc. between people on different charts. It also draws twins, triplets, etc. with slanted lines.
Unfortunately, the ability to upload new releases seems to have been turned off by Google. Contact the developer (missionary.nerd@verizon.net) for Release 1.2.

<b>BUG REPORTS</b>  This is a small project. We don't have a support staff <i>per se</i>. Please post any bugs to the "Issues" section. Technical inquiries other than bugs may be addressed to missionary.nerd@verizon.net.
