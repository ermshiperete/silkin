        drawChartsHelpText.setText("*** Creating People or Unions\nClick at an empty point on the chart approximately where you\nwant a new person or union (marriage) to appear. A menu will appear \nat that point. Choose the symbol you want. To cancel the menu without\nmaking a choice, click somewhere outside the menu boundaries.\nNOTE: The menu choices to insert an existing person do not work yet.\n\n*** Relating People and Unions\nDrag a person to either the top or bottom of a union.\nDragging to the TOP of a union symbol (=) adds a link to that person as a \nparent/spouse. Dragging to the BOTTOM of a union symbol adds the \nperson as a child/sibling.\n\n***Choosing Ego\nThe first person created on a chart becomes the default Ego, i.e.\nthe focal point of the family tree. Ego is always colored red,\nand the name (and serial number) of Ego is displayed in a drop-\ndown menu in the upper right corner of the Person display. You\nmay select a different Ego at any time using this drop-down menu.\n\nIf you ALT (Mac OPTION)-CLICK on any person in the chart, they become Ego.\n\n*** Choosing Alter\nWhen you click on anyone else on the chart, they are displayed as\nblue and their information appears in the Person display. They are\ncalled 'Current Alter.' The kin term boxes on the Person display\nshow what Ego calls Alter and vice versa. Each alter, of course,\nmay have many sets of kin terms: one set for each possible alter.\n\nEntering the kin terms used by Ego and Alter is the chief purpose\nof SILKin. (See \"Editing Charts\" re: terms of address and entering\nmultiple kin terms.\n\n*** Linking Kinsmen\nAll persons who are part of the chain of relations between Ego and\nAlter are displayed in yellow/orange. For example, if Alter is married\nto Ego's granddaughter, Ego will be red, Alter will be blue, Alter's wife\n(the granddaughter) will be yellow, and one of the granddaughter's\nparents will be yellow. If there are multiple paths between Ego and\nAlter, SILKin will choose the shortest one.\n\n*** Labelling People on the Chart\nIf you have entered names for people these names can be used to\nlabel the symbols. In the 'Labels' menu you may choose the labelling \nstyle: Initials, First Name, Last Name or Whole Name. You can change \nthe style at any time.\n\nThe labelling style does not affect the way you enter names, only\nthe display on the chart. If you do not enter names, default \nnames (Person 1, Person 2 etc.) are generated automatically.\n\nThe 'Labels' menu also allows you to display the kin term used by \nthe current Ego for the current Alter. You may choose terms of \naddress or terms of reference. You also may choose to place a letter\n(A, B, ...) under each person's symbol that represents their kin \nterm. That shoud make it easier to see patterns of kin terms.\n\n*** Making the Chart Editable or Static\nThe Context menu has a \"Context is Editable\" item. When it is checked, \nthe diagram can be changed. If it is unchecked, the diagram is immutable. \n\n*** Saving your Chart and Data\nThe File Menu has 'Save' and 'Save As' options similar to other\nsoftware programs. Use 'Save As' to change the file name or location.\n\nYour data is saved in SILK files with an extension \".silk\"; this\nformat uses a slightly modified version of XML, (eXtended Markup Language). \nBecause of these modifications, SILK files cannot be displayed in XML browsers.\nYou can view them as plain text (if you are willing to search through the XML \nformatting code). You should be very careful not to modify these files while \nviewing them; this could corrupt the file and make it unusable in SILKin.\n\n*** Loading a Saved Chart\nIn the File Menu select 'Open' and navigate to the folder where\nyour SILK file is stored. The suggested (and default) location is the\n'Context Under Construction' folder in the 'Library' folder in the\nSILKin folder. ");
