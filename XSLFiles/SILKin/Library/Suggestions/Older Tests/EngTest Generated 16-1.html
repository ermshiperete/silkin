<h3>1. <i>bro</i> (proposed definition)</h3>
<p>The term <i>bro</i> looks similar to other terms in the kinship database (<i>mama_mo_noko</i> in Pagibete, <i>bhai</i> in Gujarati, <i>babal</i> in Keriera Australian, <i>bra</i> in Magyar). In these languages, the term is defined as follows: </p>
<blockquote>brother or mother's father's child's child's <i>test</i> male</blockquote>
<p>Consider each of the following questions in turn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches "brother", but is
               not called <i>bro</i>? </li>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches "mother's father's child's child's test male", but is
               not called <i>bro</i>? </li>
<li>Are there any other relationships called <i>bro</i> that are not covered by the above?</li>
</ol>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your answer to all of these questions is "No", then go to "Act on Suggestions" in the
            Context menu and Accept the proposed
            definition.</li>
<li>For every "Yes" answer, go to
            the genealogy editor and add examples of the relationships
            that do not fit the proposed definition.
            The proposed definition will go away the next time you "Get New Suggestions".
            You
            may also go to "Act on Suggestions" in the Context menu and
            specify Reject in order to remove this item from the
            list of pending suggestions.  Note, however, if you
            simply Reject without entering any
            counterevidence, the same suggestion will return when you
            "Get New Suggestions".</li>
<li>If you are not sure, you can
            do nothing for now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. <i>bro_in_law</i> (possible umbrella term)</h3>
<p>The term <i>bro_in_law</i> appears to be an umbrella term covering:
      </p>
<blockquote>
<i>brother_in_law</i>
</blockquote>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is true, go to "Act on Suggestions" in the
         Context menu and Accept this suggestion.</li>
<li>If the two terms are really synonyms, go to "Act on Suggestions" in the
                  Context menu and choose "Make these synonyms".</li>
<li>If the terms actually have overlapping ranges of
                  meaning, go to the genealogy editor and add
                  examples of relationships that will illustrate the
                  difference between these two terms. The umbrella-term  proposal will
                  then go away the next time you "Get New Suggestions". You
                  may also go to "Act on Suggestions" in the Context menu and
                  specify Reject in order to remove this item from the
                  list of pending suggestions.  Note, however, if you

</dl>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is true, go to "Act on Suggestions" in the
            Context menu and Accept this suggestion. Be sure to use the radio buttons to select the
            term that is primary before clicking Accept.</li>
<li>If one of these terms is just a misspelling of the proper
            term, go to the genealogy editor and fix the spelling.
            Choose each of the listed Ego to Alter pairs in turn, and
            correct the spelling in the appropriate data field.</li>
<li>If the terms are not synonyms, go to the genealogy editor and add
            examples of relationships that will illustrate the
            difference between these two terms. The synonym proposal will
            then go away the next time you "Get New Suggestions". You

<blockquote>wife's sister or wife's mother's father's child's child's <i>test</i> female</blockquote>
<p>Consider each of the following questions in turn:</p>

               not called <i>sister_in_law</i>? </li>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches "wife's mother's father's child's child's test female", but is
               not called <i>sister_in_law</i>? </li>
<li>Are there any other relationships called <i>sister_in_law</i> that are not covered by the above?</li>
</ol>

<li>If your answer to all of these questions is "No", then go to "Act on Suggestions" in the

<li>For every "Yes" answer, go to
            the genealogy editor and add examples of the relationships
            that do not fit the proposed definition.

            specify Reject in order to remove this item from the
            list of pending suggestions.  Note, however, if you
            simply Reject without entering any
            counterevidence, the same suggestion will return when you
            "Get New Suggestions".</li>
<li>If you are not sure, you can
            do nothing for now.</li>
