	<a name="17"></a><h3>17. <i>uncle</i> (possible anomaly)</h3><p>There is definition in the library of known kinship systems
            that looks like a close fit for 
            <i>uncle</i>.
            That definition is as follows:
         </p><blockquote>parent's brother or parent's sister's husband or mother's father's child's child's <i>test</i> male</blockquote><p>However, there are one or more dyads that
               fit the above definition but have not been
               labeled as
               <i>uncle</i>;
               see Ego-Alter dyads:
      5-13
            (<i>oncle</i>)
         , 2-16
            (<i>oncle</i>)
         </p><p>Go back to the genealogy editor and double check that these
            dyads are entered correctly.</p><p>Options:</p><ul><li>If any of these dyads has the wrong kin term assigned or
               the term is misspelled,  use the
               genealogy editor to correct the term.</li><li>If any of these cases involves a synonym or a regional
            variant, use the genealogy editor to add the primary term
            to the record for the dyad.</li><li>If any of these dyads is indeed correct as it stands (indicating
               that the identified definition is not quite right for the
               term), go to "Act on Suggestions" in the
               Context menu and open this suggestion. Select the Confirm 
               option for each dyad that is correct. This will cause
               the system to stop trying to fit this particular
               definition.</li><li>If you are not sure, you can
               do nothing for now.</li></ul>
