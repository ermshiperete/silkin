<h3>1. <i>aunt</i> (proposed definition)</h3>
<p>The term <i>aunt</i> looks similar to other terms in the kinship database (<i>nena</i> in Pagibete, <i>atchunga</i> in Eskimo Baffin Bay, <i>atsaga</i> in Eskimo Greenland, <i>phui</i> in Gujarati). In these languages, the term is defined as
         follows: </p>
<blockquote>father's sister or father's mother's father's child's child's <i>test</i> female</blockquote>
<p>Consider each of the following questions in turn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "father's sister", but is not called <i>aunt</i>? </li>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "father's mother's father's child's child's test female", but is not called <i>aunt</i>? </li>
<li>Are there any other relationships called <i>aunt</i> that are not covered by the above?</li>
</ol>
<p>Options:</p>

<li>If your answer to all of these questions is "No", then

            specify Reject now in order to remove this item from the
            list of pending suggestions. Note, however, if you simply
            Reject without entering any counterevidence, SILKin will never repeat this suggestion -- but you are not helping it find a better one
            the next time you "Get New Suggestions".</li>
