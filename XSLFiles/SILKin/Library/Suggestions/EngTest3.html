<h3>1. <i>aunt</i> (data request)</h3>
<p>To resolve a conflict between several possible definitions
         for <i>aunt</i>, we need to
         provide some dyads that are not yet in the data. Please
         provide at least one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The needed dyad is formally specified as the
                  following path or relationships from Ego to Alter:
               </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p> There is not yet
                     a pair of people in the data who are related in
                     that way. Can you find such a pair, add the
                     missing persons to the genealogy chart, and then
                     supply the kin term for that dyad? </p>
</li>

<h3>2. <i>daddy</i> (proposed definition)</h3>
<p>The term <i>daddy</i> looks similar to other terms in the kinship database (<i>pacu</i> in Tucano, <i>ama</i> in Agta, <i>jate</i> in Cogui, <i>jipacu</i> in Cubeo). In these languages, the term is defined as
         follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>father</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider each of the following questions in turn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "father", but is not called <i>daddy</i>? </li>
<li>Are there any other relationships called <i>daddy</i> that are not covered by the above?</li>
</ol>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your answer to all of these questions is "No", then
            Accept the proposed definition.</li>
<li>For every "Yes" answer, go to the genealogy editor and
            add examples of the relationships that do not fit the
            proposed definition. The proposed definition will go away
            the next time you "Get New Suggestions". You may also
            specify Reject now in order to remove this item from the
            list of pending suggestions. Note, however, if you simply
            Reject without entering any counterevidence, the same
            suggestion will return when you "Get New
            Suggestions".</li>
<li>If you are not sure, you can do nothing for now.</li>
</ul>
