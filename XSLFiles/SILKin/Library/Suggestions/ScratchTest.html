<h2>Pending issues</h2>

<h3>1. <i>bro</i> (proposed definition)</h3>
<p>The term <i>bro</i> looks similar to other terms in the kinship database (<i>mama_mo_noko</i> in Pagibete, <i>bhai</i> in Gujarati, <i>babal</i> in Keriera Australian, <i>bra</i> in Magyar). In these languages, the term is defined as
         follows: </p>
<blockquote>brother or mother's father's child's child's <i>test</i> male</blockquote>
<p>Consider each of the following questions in turn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "brother", but is not called <i>bro</i>? </li>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "mother's father's child's child's test male", but is not called <i>bro</i>? </li>
<li>Are there any other relationships called <i>bro</i> that are not covered by the above?</li>
</ol>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your answer to all of these questions is "No", then
            Accept the proposed definition.</li>
<li>For every "Yes" answer, go to the genealogy editor and
            add examples of the relationships that do not fit the
            proposed definition. The proposed definition will go away
            the next time you "Get New Suggestions". You may also
            specify Reject now in order to remove this item from the
            list of pending suggestions. Note, however, if you simply
            Reject without entering any counterevidence, SILKin will never repeat this suggestion -- but you are not helping it find a better one
            the next time you "Get New Suggestions".</li>
<li>If you are not sure, you can do nothing for now.</li>
</ul>
