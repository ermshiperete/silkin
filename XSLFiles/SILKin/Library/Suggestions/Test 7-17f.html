<h3>1. <i>daddy</i> (possible anomaly)</h3>
<p>There is a definition in the library of known kinship
            systems that looks like a close fit for <i>daddy</i>. That definition is as
            follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>father</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there are a few dyads that are preventing a
               perfect fit with the above definition. Either they use the
               term and don't fit the definition, or they fit the
               definition but don't use the term;
               see Ego-Alter dyad: 7-0 (<i>daddy</i>) .
            </p>
<p>The action box for anomalies allows you to review each of
            these dyads and act accordingly. Select each of the dyads
            in turn from the dropdown list, and click the 
            radio button for the appropriate action:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are not sure, you may select "No Action" and do 
            nothing for now.</li>
<li>If the dyad is correct as it stands, select "This dyad
               is CORRECT". This will cause the system to 
               stop trying to fit this particular definition and to no
               longer doubt this dyad in the future.</li>
<li>If the dyad is completely wrong, you may simply select
            "This dyad is wrong; DELETE it" to remove it from the genealogy chart.</li>
<li>If the dyad has the wrong kin term assigned
               or the term is misspelled, select "EDIT the kin term
               to" and type the correct term into the text box.</li>
<li>If the problem involves a synonym or a regional
               variant, and you want to have multiple terms assigned
               to the dyad, click on the button for "SHOW This Dyad on
               the Chart" to open the genealogy editor with
               this dyad already selected and edit as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>After selecting one of the
            radio buttons, click the button for "RECORD Decision on
            This Dyad"  before
            moving to the next dyad.</p>

<h3>2. <i>sonny</i> (proposed definition)</h3>
<p>The term <i>sonny</i> looks similar to other terms in the kinship database (<i>macu</i> in Tucano, <i>sukkua</i> in Cogui, <i>jimacu</i> in Cubeo, <i>bucu</i> in Cubeo(Adr)). In these languages, the term is defined as
         follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>son</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider each of the following questions in turn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "son", but is not called <i>sonny</i>? </li>
<li>Are there any other relationships called <i>sonny</i> that are not covered by the above?</li>
</ol>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your answer to all of these questions is "No", then
            Accept the proposed definition.</li>
<li>For every "Yes" answer, go to the genealogy editor and
            add examples of the relationships that do not fit the
            proposed definition. The proposed definition will go away
            the next time you "Get New Suggestions". You may also
            specify Reject now in order to remove this item from the
            list of pending suggestions. Note, however, if you simply
            Reject without entering any counterevidence, the same
            suggestion will return when you "Get New
            Suggestions".</li>
<li>If you are not sure, you can do nothing for now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. <i>sweetie</i> (proposed definition)</h3>
<p>The term <i>sweetie</i> looks similar to other terms in the kinship database (<i>wakdakga</i> in Tuscarora, <i>asawa</i> in Agta, <i>dayakeneyaseh</i> in Cayuga, <i>sewa</i> in Cogui). In these languages, the term is defined as
         follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>husband or </li>
<li>wife</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider each of the following questions in turn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "husband", but is not called <i>sweetie</i>? </li>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "wife", but is not called <i>sweetie</i>? </li>
<li>Are there any other relationships called <i>sweetie</i> that are not covered by the above?</li>
</ol>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your answer to all of these questions is "No", then
            Accept the proposed definition.</li>
<li>For every "Yes" answer, go to the genealogy editor and
            add examples of the relationships that do not fit the
            proposed definition. The proposed definition will go away
            the next time you "Get New Suggestions". You may also
            specify Reject now in order to remove this item from the
            list of pending suggestions. Note, however, if you simply
            Reject without entering any counterevidence, the same
            suggestion will return when you "Get New
            Suggestions".</li>
<li>If you are not sure, you can do nothing for now.</li>
