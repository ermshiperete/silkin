<h2>Pending issues</h2>

<h3>1. <i>aunt</i> (proposed definition)</h3>
<p>The term <i>aunt</i> looks similar to other terms in the kinship database (<i>aunt</i> in English, <i>aunt</i> in English). In these languages, the term is defined as
         follows: </p>
<blockquote>parent's sister or parent's brother's wife or mother's mother's father's child's child's <i>test</i> female or father's mother's father's child's child's <i>test</i> female or mother's mother's father's child's child's <i>test</i> male wife or father's mother's father's child's child's <i>test</i> male wife</blockquote>
<p>Consider each of the following questions in turn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "parent's sister", but is not called <i>aunt</i>? </li>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "parent's brother's wife", but is not called <i>aunt</i>? </li>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "mother's mother's father's child's child's test female", but is not called <i>aunt</i>? </li>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "father's mother's father's child's child's test female", but is not called <i>aunt</i>? </li>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "mother's mother's father's child's child's test male wife", but is not called <i>aunt</i>? </li>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "father's mother's father's child's child's test male wife", but is not called <i>aunt</i>? </li>
<li>Are there any other relationships called <i>aunt</i> that are not covered by the above?</li>
</ol>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your answer to all of these questions is "No", then
            Accept the proposed definition.</li>
<li>For every "Yes" answer, go to the genealogy editor and
            add examples of the relationships that do not fit the
            proposed definition. The proposed definition will go away
            the next time you "Get New Suggestions". You may also
            specify Reject now in order to remove this item from the
            list of pending suggestions. Note, however, if you simply
            Reject without entering any counterevidence, SILKin will never repeat this suggestion -- but you are not helping it find a better one
            the next time you "Get New Suggestions".</li>
<li>If you are not sure, you can do nothing for now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. <i>dad</i> (possible synonym)</h3>
<p>The following two terms (covering kintype "Fa") appear to be synonyms: </p>
<dl>
<dd>
<i>dad</i>&nbsp; () </dd>
<dd>
<i>daddy</i>&nbsp; (see Ego-Alter dyads: 9-5, 11-7, 2-0, 15-13) </dd>
</dl>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is true, Accept this suggestion. Be sure to use
            the radio buttons to select the term that is primary
            before clicking Accept.</li>
<li>If one of these terms is just a misspelling of the proper
            term, go to the genealogy editor and fix the spelling.
            Choose each of the listed Ego to Alter pairs in turn, and
            correct the spelling in the appropriate data field.</li>
<li>If the terms are not synonyms, go to the genealogy editor
            and add examples of relationships that will illustrate the
            difference between these two terms. The synonym proposal
            will then go away the next time you "Get New Suggestions".
            You may also specify Reject now in order to remove this
            item from the list of pending suggestions. Note, however,
            if you simply Reject without entering any counterevidence,
            SILKin wil be blocked from learning the distinction between
            the terms.</li>
<li>If you are not sure, you can do nothing for now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. <i>daughter_term</i> (proposed definition)</h3>
<p>The term <i>daughter_term</i> looks similar to other terms in the kinship database (<i>morwadi</i> in Tswana, <i>munzhi</i> in Cogui, <i>jimaco</i> in Cubeo, <i>buco</i> in Cubeo(Adr)). In these languages, the term is defined as
         follows: </p>
<blockquote>daughter or daughter</blockquote>
<p>Consider each of the following questions in turn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "daughter", but is not called <i>daughter_term</i>? </li>
<li>Can you think of a relationship that matches
                  "daughter", but is not called <i>daughter_term</i>? </li>
<li>Are there any other relationships called <i>daughter_term</i> that are not covered by the above?</li>
</ol>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your answer to all of these questions is "No", then
            Accept the proposed definition.</li>
<li>For every "Yes" answer, go to the genealogy editor and
            add examples of the relationships that do not fit the
            proposed definition. The proposed definition will go away
            the next time you "Get New Suggestions". You may also
            specify Reject now in order to remove this item from the
            list of pending suggestions. Note, however, if you simply
            Reject without entering any counterevidence, SILKin will never repeat this suggestion -- but you are not helping it find a better one
            the next time you "Get New Suggestions".</li>
<li>If you are not sure, you can do nothing for now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. <i>grandparent</i> (possible umbrella term)</h3>
<p>The term <i>grandparent</i> appears to be an umbrella term covering: </p>
<blockquote>
<i>grandma</i>, <i>grandpa</i>
</blockquote>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is true, Accept this suggestion.</li>
<li>If the listed sub-terms do not fall completely
                  within the range of <i>grandparent</i>, go to the genealogy editor and add examples of
                  relationships that will illustrate that the other
                  terms fall outside the range of <i>grandparent</i>. The umbrella-term proposal will then go away
                  the next time you "Get New Suggestions". You may
                  also specify Reject now in order to remove this item
                  from the list of pending suggestions. Note, however,
            	  if you simply Reject without entering any counterevidence,
            	  SILKin wil be blocked from learning the distinction between
            	  the terms. </li>
<li>If you are not sure, you can do nothing for now.</li>

<h3>8. <i>uncle</i> (data request)</h3>
<p>To resolve a conflict between several possible definitions
         for <i>uncle</i>, we need to
         provide some dyads that are not yet in the data. Please
         provide at least one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The needed dyad is <i>mother's mother's mother's father's child's child's <i>test</i> female son</i>.  There is not yet
                     a pair of people in the data who are related in
                     that way. Can you find such a pair, add the
                     missing persons to the genealogy chart, and then
                     supply the kin term for that dyad? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The needed dyad is <i>mother's mother's mother's father's child's child's <i>test</i> female daughter's wife</i>.  There is not yet
