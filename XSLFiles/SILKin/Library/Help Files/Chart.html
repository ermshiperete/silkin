<h3> Ego, Alter, and Linking Kinsmen</h3>
<p>The first person created on a chart becomes the default <span style="color:red">Ego</span>, i.e. the focal point of the family tree. <span style="color:red">Ego</span> is always colored red, and the name (and serial number) of <span style="color:red">Ego</span> is displayed in a drop-down menu in the upper right corner of the Person display. You may select a different <span style="color:red">Ego</span> at any time using this drop-down menu. If you <span style="font-style: italic">Alt-Click</span> (on some Macs <span style="font-style: italic">Option-Click</span>) on any person in the chart, they become <span style="color:red">Ego</span>.
</p>
<p>When you click on anyone else on the chart, they are displayed in blue and their information appears in the Person display. They are
called <span style="color:blue">Alter</span>. The kin term boxes on the Person display show what <span style="color:red">Ego</span> calls <span style="color:blue">Alter</span> and vice versa. Each <span style="color:blue">Alter</span>, of course, may have many sets of kin terms: one set for each possible Ego.
</p>
<p>All persons who are part of the chain of relations between <span style="color:red">Ego</span> and
<span style="color:blue">Alter</span> (<span style="font-style: italic; color:orange">Linking Kinsmen</span>) are displayed in yellow/orange. For example, if <span style="color:blue">Alter</span> is married to <span style="color:red">Ego</span>'s granddaughter, <span style="color:red">Ego</span> will be red, <span style="color:blue">Alter</span> will be blue, <span style="color:blue">Alter</span>'s wife (the granddaughter) will be yellow, and one of the granddaughter's parents will be yellow. If there are multiple paths between <span style="color:red">Ego</span> and <span style="color:blue">Alter</span>, SILKin will choose the shortest one.
</p>

<a name="dates"></a>
<h3>Date Formats</h3>
<p>All dates in SILKin are expressed in a 'universal format' like  2011-07-21 for July 21, 2011.  If you are entering an approximate date, you can enter just the Year-Month or just the Year. If you accidentally enter a date in your native format, SILKin will try to interpret it; if it cannot you will get an error message. You should form the habit of entering dates 
in Year-Month-Day numeric format.
</p>
<a name="label"></a>
<h3> Labeling Options for People</h3>
<p>If you have entered names for people these names can be used to label the symbols. In the 'Labels' menu you may choose the labelling style: Initials, First Name, Last Name or Whole Name. You can change the style at any time. The labelling style does not affect the way you enter names, only
the display on the chart. If you do not enter names, SILKin will display a person's serial number in angle brackets (e.g. &lt;15&gt;) under each person's symbol.
</p>
<p>The 'Labels' menu also allows you to display the kin term used by the current Ego for the current Alter. You may choose terms of address or terms of reference. You also may choose to place a letter (A, B, ...) under each person's symbol that represents their kin term. That should make it easier to see patterns of kin terms.
</p>

<h3>Making the Chart Editable or Static</h3>
<p>
The Context menu has a 'Context is Editable' item. When it is checked, 
the diagram can be changed. If it is unchecked, the diagram is immutable. The normal (default) setting allows editing. But if, for example, you are examining someone else's data you can uncheck this box to assure that you do not accidentally change their data.
</p>

<h3>Reshaping the Chart</h3>
<p>If you want to tidy up your chart, you can drag any person or union to a new location with the mouse. If you run out of room on the screen, 
simply scroll up, down, or sideways to get more room. Scroll bars will appear once your chart is larger than the viewing area. Whenever you 
place a person or union right on the edge of the chart, it will automatically add an empty space to allow room for one more. To force
the chart to grow, keep placing objects right on the edge. If you later move a person or union away from the edge, the chart will NOT get
smaller.
</p>
<p>You can make charts as large as you like. The bigger they are, the more scrolling you must do to locate someone.
</p>
<a name="move"></a>
<h3>Moving People and Unions</h3>
<p>Click on and drag a person or union symbol to move it. The links will  be redrawn. If you hold down the <span style="font-style: italic">Shift key</span> and move a union, you will also move the immediate nuclear family associated with that union. If you hold down the <span style="font-style: italic">Alt key</span> (also a Mac's <span style="font-style: italic">Command key</span>) while moving a union you will move the entire lineage descended from that union.
</p>
<a name="del-rel"></a>
<h3>Deleting Relationships</h3>
<p>Drag a person to either the top (if they are a parent/spouse) or bottom (if they are a child/sibling) of a union. If there was a relationship, it will be deleted. Dropping a person on a union 'toggles' a relationship; when you initially drop someone on the bottom of a union symbol, you add them as a child of the union. If you drop them on the bottom again, you delete them as a child of the union.
</p>
<p>The next time you Save (or Save As) your data, all the relationships you deleted will be erased from the SILK file, and any kin terms you entered for those relationships (dyads) are erased. This action cannot be undone. If you immediately re-connect the person to their family, all their relationships (links) will be restored, but <span style="font-style: italic">the kin terms will not be restored.</span> 
</p>
<p>Of course, if the relationship in question was erroneous, deleting it is exactly the right thing to do. However, in view of the serious, irreversible consequences of deleting a relationship, you should be cautious about it. Here are some things you might consider before deleting:
<ul>
<li>Do 'Save As' to a new file name. For example: if your project is called <span style="font-style: italic">Zulu</span> then 'Save As' to <span style="font-style: italic">Zulu-A</span>. All changes you make will only affect the new file; the original file will preserve the prior state of your project. </li>
<li> Perhaps just editing the person will correct the errors. </li>
<li> If a member of a family has died, you should not delete them. Simply enter the date of death in their Data Panel. Their chart symbol will gain a cross-out to signify their demise. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<a name="del-ppl"></a>
<h3>Deleting People or Unions</h3>
<p>If you hold down the <span style="font-style: italic">Control key</span> and click on a person's symbol, they will be deleted <span style="font-style: italic">if</span> they are not Ego and are not linked to any union. This is a safety precaution because deleting a person has side-effects: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Ego cannot be deleted because the Data Panel cannot display kin terms without an Ego. If you need to delete Ego, choose someone else to be Ego first, then delete. </li>
	<li> All dyads involving the deleted person as either Ego or Alter are immediately destroyed. </li>
	<li> If the deleted person is a linking kinsman between two other people, that link is destroyed along with all dyads that rely on that link. </li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, if you attempt to delete a union that still has persons linked to it, SILKin may reject your deletion attempt. <span style="font-weight: bold">BE CAREFUL.</span> Do not delete the person if you only need to delete a relationship (see <a href="#del-rel">above</a>).</p>
<p>The next time you Save (or Save As) your data, all the people and unions you deleted will be erased from the SILK file. This action cannot be undone.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold">Clear All</span> entry under the File menu deletes all people, unions and relationships <span style="font-weight: bold">from your screen</span>. It does not erase them from the SILK file; it disconnects your chart from the SILK file. It gives you a blank slate upon which to create a new chart (with a new project name and new SILK file).
